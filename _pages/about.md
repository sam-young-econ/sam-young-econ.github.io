Hello, thank you for visiting.

I am an applied economist with 7+ years of work experience.  I received my Ph.D. in Economics from UC San Diego in 2017, with my dissertation focusing on the economics of education.  From 2017 to 2025, I worked at Amazon/AWS.  Outside of school and work, I have conducted independent research on baseball and sports analytics.
