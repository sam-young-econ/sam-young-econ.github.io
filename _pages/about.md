I am an applied economist with 7+ years of work experience.  I received my Ph.D. in Economics from UC San Diego in 2017, with my dissertation focusing on the economics of education.  From 2017 to 2025, I worked at Amazon/AWS.  Outside of school and work, I have conducted independent research on baseball and sports analytics.

My resume can be found [here](https://sam-young-econ.github.io/files/Sam Young resume 2025-02-12_with fields.pdf).

The [Research](https://sam-young-econ.github.io/research/) tab contains copies of papers that I wrote.
* Please note that I am unable to share documents that I authored while at Amazon, due to the non-disclosure agreement (NDA) as part of my terms of employment.
