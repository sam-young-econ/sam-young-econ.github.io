<br>
Published in <i>Public Policy Institute of California</i>, April 2016

Co-authored with Julian R. Betts, Andrew C. Zau, and Karen Volz Bachofer
<p style="font-size: 0.85em;">Beginning with the class of 2016, San Diego Unified School District increased its graduation standards to require more college preparatory coursework. Using an event study methodology, we analyze the effects of this policy change on students in the classes of 2016-2018. Based on data through summer 2015, the new graduation standards appear to be helping some students while hurting others. Compared to other recent cohorts, the affected graduating classes have significantly increased their rates of completing college prep courses and are projected to have higher rates of students eligible to attend the state’s public universities. However, these cohorts are also projected to have lower graduation rates.</p>

<a href="http://sam-young-econ.github.io/files/Betts Young Choice-Lottery 2017-06-14.pdf">The Long-Term Effects of Public School Choice: Lottery Evidence from San Diego</a>
<br>
Co-authored with Julian R. Betts, Andrew C. Zau, and Karen Volz Bachofer
<p style="font-size: 0.85em;">Existing studies of school choice often analyze effects on near-term student achievement, but typically not longer-term outcomes such as college attendance and postsecondary achievement. This paper estimates the effects of school choice on postsecondary outcomes – including the number of years attended and highest degree earned within five years of high school graduation – using exogenous variation from school choice lotteries in San Diego Unified School District.</p>

<a href="http://sam-young-econ.github.io/files/Admissions Paper 2017-06-14.pdf">Do Colleges Favor Students from Lower-Achieving High Schools? Evidence from the University of California</a>
<p style="font-size: 0.85em;">In addition to race and socioeconomic status, colleges may also consider the achievement level of a student's high school during admissions, perhaps favoring students from lower-achieving (disadvantaged) schools for equity or diversity reasons. This paper uses data from the University of California (UC) to estimate the direction and magnitude of how a school's overall achievement level affects admissions for otherwise-similar applicants. All else equal, I find mean school achievement to be negatively associated with admission probability at five out of eight UC campuses between 2001 and 2006. For an average campus, attending a higher-achieving school by one decile associates with a 0.8 percentage point decrease in admission probability, or about a 0.04 decrease in high school GPA.</p>

<a href="http://sam-young-econ.github.io/files/Value Added, SDUSD.pdf">How Sensitive Are School Value-Added Estimates to Methodology?</a>
<br>
Co-authored with Julian R. Betts
<p style="font-size: 0.85em;">Education scholars frequently use “value-added” models to evaluate the effectiveness of teachers or schools, to help account for differences in inputs. While the idea behind value added is simple, in practice there are many variations of the model that researchers use, which may affect the resulting estimates. In this paper, we use panel data from San Diego Unified School District (SDUSD) to examine the sensitivity of value-added estimates to (1) the control specification and (2) the overall class of value-added model.</p>

<a href="http://sam-young-econ.github.io/files/xHitting_2014-08-22.pdf">Why Don’t We Have FIP for Hitters? A Need and Attempt to De-luck Hitter Performance</a>
<br>
Poster presentation at Saber Seminar 2014
<p style="font-size: 0.85em;">Baseball analysts recognize a large component of luck in ball-in-play outcomes, which can have large impacts on a player’s nominal statistics. However, advanced metrics have done much less to adjust hitter statistics for ball-in-play luck compared to pitcher statistics. This paper proposes a method to estimate de-lucked hitter performance by estimating rates of each individual hit type (singles, doubles, triples, and home runs) using underlying peripherals. These estimated rates can then be used to compute expected versions of a wide variety of hitting statistics. Doing so, expected versions of batting average, on-base percentage, slugging, isolated power, OPS, and weighted on-base average all outperform their realized values in predicting subsequent-year performance. This aligns with existing findings for pitchers and hints at the potential to similarly evaluate hitters on a more luck-neutral basis.</p>
