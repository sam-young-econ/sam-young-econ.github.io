<br>
Published in <i>Public Policy Institute of California</i>, April 2016
<br><br>
Beginning with the class of 2016, San Diego Unified School District increased its graduation standards to require more college preparatory coursework. Using an event study methodology, we analyze the effects of this policy change on students in the classes of 2016-2018. Based on data through summer 2015, the new graduation standards appear to be helping some students while hurting others. Compared to other recent cohorts, the affected graduating classes have significantly increased their rates of completing college prep courses and are projected to have higher rates of students eligible to attend the state’s public universities. However, these cohorts are also projected to have lower graduation rates.

<br>
Poster presentation at Saber Seminar 2014

Baseball analysts recognize a large component of luck in ball-in-play outcomes, which can have large impacts on a player’s nominal statistics. However, advanced metrics have done much less to adjust hitter statistics for ball-in-play luck compared to pitcher statistics. This paper proposes a method to estimate de-lucked hitter performance by estimating rates of each individual hit type (singles, doubles, triples, and home runs) using underlying peripherals. These estimated rates can then be used to compute expected versions of a wide variety of hitting statistics. Doing so, expected versions of batting average, on-base percentage, slugging, isolated power, OPS, and weighted on-base average all outperform their realized values in predicting subsequent-year performance. This aligns with existing findings for pitchers and hints at the potential to similarly evaluate hitters on a more luck-neutral basis.
